# Printed Circuit Boards

this is a local store with notes on etching copper (mainly
to make pcbs but you could use it for any copper etching)
and ways to get the etch resist onto the copper.

what most interests me is using a laser printer to create
the etch resist. 

* using electroplating with the pbc as the source (anode) to
  deposit the copper onto the negative electrode (cathode)
    * this should also work with a copper sulphate solution
    * possible it may work with any conducting liquid

        * [salt water electro etch](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Saltwater-etch-process/)
            * using saturated salt to create a conducting liquid
        * [salt and vinegar \(without peroxide\)](https://www.electro-tech-online.com/threads/electro-etching-no-acid.33876/)
            * instead of using hydrogen peroxide to allow
            the acid to etch, this uses salt and vinegar as
            the conducting liquid
* using salt + vinegar or HCL with Hydrogen peroxide
    * the chemistry of Cu in NaCL + CH3COOH + H2O2

        * in the comments someone points out that cola
          contains phosphoric acid, which may etch as just as well
